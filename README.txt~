**Splinterfields**

<<<<<<< HEAD
Splinter Fields is an initiative of Brussels based organizations active within the fields of technological and media arts (Constant, FoAM, nadine and OKNO) to foster collaborative, agile and flexible learning. The programme of workshops, study-groups and field-tests is open to artists, designers, technologists and other generalists curious to explore tools and mindware for experiments in contemporary culture and daily life.



This repo was created for the collabarative building and designing of the Splinterfields flyer on the 25th of june 2013.

OSP comes with a suggestion to combine Tom Lechner's Laidout and Undertype â€”an old type setting software that Pierre M made a few years ago.

The group splits up to divide final editing of the text for the flyer (there is a lot of content) and start getting to grips with the two tools.

Builing Undertype with SVN and following Tom's instructions on laidout.org.



	Undertype files can be found at http://home.gna.org/undertype/
	Here is the description of one system's succesful build:
	1.First step is to make a new directory in your newly downloaded undertype folder, then change directory to it.
	mkdir build
	cd build
	2.Next making sure that you have qmake.If not, you can uptain it through aptitude by running
	aptitude install qt4-qmake
	3.It's a good idea to have the dev tools for qt4 for smooth running of undertype, so run this command too 
	aptitude install libqt4-dev
	4.All prerequesites should be available, so you can just run in the /undertype/build folder
	make
	and check if all has worked. 
	5.CD to newly built /bin and run ./undertype

	basic instructions can be found at http://home.gna.org/undertype/manual.pdf


Undertype was originally built as an educationnal platform to make apparent the processes that a typesetting engine may go through. It was purposely rudimentary and bare. For todays purpose, Pierre built a version that allows for copying and pasting functions. We may take these abilities for granted, but they didn't necessarely fit in the original idea of the program. Undertype imitates a linotype machine as is sets slugs of text line by line and one by one. Reenacting digitally what these machines did with masters and hot lead. 

The imagined workflow will be to use both Laidout and Undertype: Undertype will be the tool to set the text in sections. This combination came about as Laidout does not enable text setting functions. Outputted pdf files from Undertype will be rasterised and imported into Laidout as images (the idea from the beggining is to print the flyers on a risograph machine) then images, logos, etc will be laidout in Laidout.
