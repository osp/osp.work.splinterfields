**Splinterfields**

<<<<<<< HEAD
Splinter Fields is an initiative of Brussels based organizations active within the fields of technological and media arts (Constant, FoAM, nadine and OKNO) to foster collaborative, agile and flexible learning. The programme of workshops, study-groups and field-tests is open to artists, designers, technologists and other generalists curious to explore tools and mindware for experiments in contemporary culture and daily life.



This repo was created for the collabarative building and designing of the Splinterfields flyer on the 25th of june 2013.

OSP comes with a suggestion to combine Tom Lechner's Laidout and Undertype â€”an old type setting software that Pierre M made a few years ago.

The group splits up to divide final editing of the text for the flyer (there is a lot of content) and start getting to grips with the two tools.

Builing Undertype with SVN and following Tom's instructions on laidout.org.



Undertype files can be found at http://home.gna.org/undertype/
Here is the description of one system's succesful build:
1.First step is to make a new directory in your newly downloaded undertype folder, then change directory to it.
mkdir build
cd build
2.Next making sure that you have qmake.If not, you can uptain it through aptitude by running
aptitude install qt4-qmake
3.It's a good idea to have the dev tools for qt4 for smooth running of undertype, so run this command too 
aptitude install libqt4-dev
4.All prerequesites should be available, so you can just run in the /undertype/build folder
make
and check if all has worked. 
5.CD to newly built /bin and run ./undertype

basic instructions can be found at http://home.gna.org/undertype/manual.pdf
